right hemisphere datapoints are consistently easier to predict that left datapoints

control datapoints are consistently easier to predict that huntington datapoints

combining control and huntington datapoints inconsistently yielded same, or marginally better accuarcy

combining right and left hemisphere datapoints inconsistently yielded same, or marginally better accuarcy

including clinical data for the huntington datapoints resulted in less overfitting and better accuarcy (BUT still worse than control datapoints)

a larger kernel size is better (still experimenting what is the best)

t1t2 is better

including target region features resulted in less overfitting, and marginally worse accuarcy

including basal ganglia features resulted in more overfitting, and worse accuarcy

including basal ganglia and brain features resulted in more overfitting, and worse accuarcy

two stage model consistently yielded much better accuarcy
(where the first stage predicts the label, and the second stage predicts the strength of the connectivity, reinforcing the 'not connected' labels)




TODO
-scaled vox features
