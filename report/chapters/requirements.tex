The following requirements were defined based on the objectives of this thesis:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Preprocess the data.
  \item Extract radiomics features.
  \item Observe direct correlations between extracted features and connectivity maps.
  \item Design a decision tree for predicting the connectivity maps from the extracted features.
  \item Design an \ac{FNN} for predicting the connectivity maps from the extracted features.
  \item Grid search radiomics feature extraction parameters for the best results.
  \item Design an \ac{FCNN} for predicting the connectivity maps from the T1 image.
  \item Modify the \ac{FCNN} by appending the \ac{ROI} mask to the input.
  \item Modify the \ac{FCNN} by appending the cortical target masks to the input.
  \item Design a generalized \ac{FCNN} for predicting one connectivity map at a time from the T1 image, \ac{ROI} \& target masks.
\end{enumerate}
