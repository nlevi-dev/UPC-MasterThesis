\textit{This study explores alternatives to diffusion MRI for mapping brain connectivity, predicting fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, using radiomic features derived from T1 and T2 structural MRI images. This approach aims to significantly enhance the cost and time efficiency of data acquisition, eliminating the need for diffusion MRI and tractography. The research is centered on the basal ganglia, a region primarily affected by neurodegeneration in Huntingtonâ€™s disease, comparing its characteristics between control subjects and patients with the condition.}
