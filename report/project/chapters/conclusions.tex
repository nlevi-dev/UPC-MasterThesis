Further investigating the sex imbalance issue discovered in \reflink{sec:inclusive}{subsection}, reveals that with the used seed for the experimentation is not terribly imbalanced for the most part, but there are definitely room for improvement by enforcing a constant ratio. The male/female ratio for the control record splits are $0.49$/$0.67$/$0.67$ (train/validation/test), and for the patient records are $0.62$/$0.5$/$1$.
