The hyperparameters listed in \reflink{tab:hypcom}{Table} were kept constant during all of the experiments:
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Hyperparameter} & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline

\end{tabular}

\section{Subcortical Segmentation}

This simple problem did not require much tuning, as it worked very well almost from the start. The set of hyperparameters reported in \reflink{tab:subhyp}{Table} remained constant during these experiments:
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Hyperparameter} & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline
Control/Huntington Records & Control Only \\ \hline
Left/Right Hemisphere Datapoints & Both \\ \hline
Space & Native \\ \hline
Image & T1 \\ \hline
Scaling/Normalization & Normalized Voxel Based Features \\ \hline
Hidden Layers & 1024 \rightarrow 512 \rightarrow 256 \rightarrow 128 \\ \hline
Loss & Categorical Crossentropy \\ \hline
Activation & Sigmoid (softmax for the output layer) \\ \hline
Learning Rate & 0.001 \\ \hline
Batch Size & 10000 \\ \hline
Early Stopping Patience & 7 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Hyperparameters: Subcortical}
\label{tab:subhyp}
\end{table}
The reasoning behind the initial choices of these parameters is straightforward. The T1 image and native space were chosen, because those are the simplest to acquire in practice. Thus, if the model performs well with those, there is no need for more complicated inputs. Including both hemispheres would hopefully result in a model which can generalize better. Only using control datapoints should translate into less variance between the general characteristics of the datapoints, as it does not contain patients with neurodegeneration. The number and sizes of the hidden layers were choosen based on the potential size of the input layer, which should range from $92$ (single set of voxel based features) up to $\sim1000-2000$ including many different kernel sizes and non-voxel based features as well. The choice of the categorical crossentropy loss function and the output layer's softmax activation function are standard practices for a classification problem. The Sigmoid activation function should work fine without having to deal with exploding gradients and dieing relu problems. The default learning rate of the Adam optimizer in TensorFlow is chosen, while a batch size of $10,000$ seems appropriate for a train split size of $1,000,000$ datapoints. The early stopping patience of 7 epochs should also be good enough to prevent overfitting and stop the training in time, but it will be evaluated on the basis of the learning curves and the accuracy of the model.\par
The metric used for evaluating model performance on the Train/Validation/Test splits is Accuracy. The 'k' and 'b' notations stand for kernel and bin, where k5 means a kernel width of 5mm, b25 means an absolute bin size of 25, and b10r means relative binning with 10 bins. In the case of multiple kernel sizes denoted by a dash, it naturally only means odd kernel sizes. \reflink{tab:expsub}{Table} reports the results of the subcortical experiments:

\begin{longtable}[H]{|r|p{9cm}|l|l|l|r|}

\caption{Hyperparameter Tuning: Subcortical}
\label{tab:expsub}
\end{longtable}

The best performing model was that of experiment 9, which achieved a near $96\%$ accuracy with practically no overfitting. The biggest improvement during the experiments was to include many different kernel sizes for the voxel based features. The additional non-voxel based features of the \ac{ROI} yielded only a small improvement, while balancing the data yielded a marginal improvement, by reducing overfitting.\par
Examples of the true/predicted records can be found in \reflink{fig:pred-tra-sub}{Figures} \ref{fig:pred-val-sub} \ref{fig:pred-tes-sub}. And the loss training curves can be found in \reflink{fig:curve-sub}{Figure}.

\section{Methodology}

The experimentation from this point on, will be divided into 4 main groups:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Native - T1
  \item Native - T1/T2
  \item Normalized - T1
  \item Normalized - T1/T2
\end{itemize}
The same set of core experiments will be run for all 4 groups, and some additional experiments will be run per group, depending on how they perform. The experiments will consider the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Single/Many Different Kernel Sizes for Voxel Based Features
  \item Additional Non-Voxel Based Features
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Single/Many Different Bin Sizes
  \end{itemize}
  \item Control/Patient/Both Records
  \item Left/Right/Both Hemisphere Datapoints
  \item Additional Clinical Features for Patient Records
  \item Additional Coordinate Map Features
  \item Scaled Voxel Based Features (not normalized)
  \item Different Bin Sizes for Voxel Based Features
  \item Different Balance Ratios
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Missing Records}

In order to be completely fair when comparing model performances, only records which are available for all 4 groups of experiments should be used. In practice, the records reported in \reflink{tab:misrec}{Table} were missing:
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Record} & \textbf{Missing Amount} \\ \hline
Normalized & 1 \\ \hline
T1/T2 & 10 \\ \hline
Diffusion \ac{FA} \& \ac{MD} & 2 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Missing Records}
\label{tab:misrec}
\end{table}
This meant that for the Diffusion \ac{FA} \& \ac{MD} experiments there were a total of 13 records omitted, yielding 57 records in total, out of which 29 are Control and 28 are Patient records. And for the Relative Connectivity experiment, 11 records were omitted, yielding 59 records in total, out of which 30 are Control and 29 are Patient records.\par
As additional experiments for the groups with more available data (such as T1, where 10 more records could be included), these records can be appended to the train split on the best performing model, which could increase the model's generalization capability and performance.

\subsection{Architecture Tuning}

For the best performing model, the architecture will be further tuned, considering the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of Layers and Layer Sizes
  \item Activation Function
  \item Batch Size
  \item Learning Rate
  \item Dropout Normalization
  \item Early Stopping Patience
\end{itemize}

\section{Diffusion Fractional Anisotropy Regression}

All the results of the \ac{FA} experiments can be found in \reflink{fig:fa-nat-t1}{Tables} \reflink{fig:fa-arch}{-}.
The baseline starting experiment tried to predict the \ac{FA} from a single set of voxel based radiomic features, with a kernel size of 5 and with the same starting hyperparameters (\reflink{tab:subhyp}{Table}) that were also used in the subcortical segmentation (with exception of the used loss function, which is Mean Squared Error instead of the Categorical Crossentropy).\par
The next few experiments were trying to determine how does each set (target regions, \ac{ROI}, and entire brain) of non-voxel based features affect the model performance. The observations were more or less consistent between the 4 different groups of experiments (Native-Normalized \& T1-T1/T2), with the final consensus being that the inclusion of the entire brain's non-voxel based features are yielding the best results, with an improvement of 5-10\% in correlation compared to the baseline. Including many different bin sized non-voxel based features worsened the model performance by 0-3\%.\par
The biggest improvement occurred with the inclusion of many different kernel sized voxel-based features, with an improvement of 10-15\%. And, surprisingly, after removing the non-voxel based features, T1 experiments performance further improved by 1-2\%, while worsening the T1/T2 experiments by 0-1\%. Running this experiment on the Patient records, resulted in the models performing even worse with the additional non-voxel based features by 8-10\%.\par
The experiments consistently showed the model performing much better on the Control records (by 5-10\%), as compared to the Patient records, with much less overfitting and better correlation.\par
The inclusion of the clinical features behaved inconsistently between the 4 groups of experiments. For the native T1, the inclusion of the \ac{CAP} and \ac{cUHDRS} features marginally improved the model performance, and for the normalized T1/T2 it improved model performance by 4-5\%, while for the native T1/T2 and normalized T1, it worsened the model performance by 5-10\%. The overall Patient records even with the best performing clinical features, were still performing worse than the Control records.\par
As expected, mixing Control and Patient records did perform worse than Control records only, but only with 1-5\% correlation.\par
The inclusion of coordinates, did not affect the T1 models' performance, but it did marginally increase the T1/T2 models' performance.\par
The use of only min-max scaling, and not normalizing the datapoints, resulted in marginally worse performance.\par
Increasing the bin size for the voxel based radiomic features marginally decreased the model performance.\par
Balancing the data was a bit inconsistent between the groups of experiments, but the balance ratio of 1 usually resulted in a marginally worse, and a balance ratio of 0.5 resulted in a marginally better performance.\par
Adding the 10 extra T1 records to the training split for the T1 experiment only resulted in a marginal improvement for the native space, and a 2\% improvement for the normalized space.\par
After combining all of the best configurations, the best performing model was the T1 normalized model, with Control records only, and with added T1 records, without any additional non-voxel based features. It reached a final correlation of \textbf{84.4/84.6/82.8} for the train/val/test splits in native space, and \textbf{84.6/84.9/82.9} in normalized space.\par
Tuning the model architecture by searching different layer sizes and numbers, activation functions, dropout normalization, adjusting learning rate and batch size, only increased the model’s overfitting, without any actual benefits.\par
Examples of the true/predicted records can be found in \reflink{fig:pred-tra-fa}{Figures} \ref{fig:pred-val-fa} \ref{fig:pred-tes-fa}. And the loss training curves can be found in \reflink{fig:curve-fa}{Figure}.

\section{Mean Diffusivity Regression}

A similar set of experiments were run for predicting \ac{MD}. The compilation of results is available from \reflink{fig:md-nat-t1}{Tables} \reflink{fig:md-arch}{-}. These experiments were showing strong performance from the onset: even the baseline Native T1 experiment with a single set of voxel based features resulted in a correlation of 94\% without any overfitting.\par
No significant observation can be made here, besides the Patient records performing marginally worse.\par
The best performing model was Native T1, on the Control records only, with the additional non-voxel based features of the entire brain, and many different voxel based kernel sizes. It reached a final correlation of \textbf{94.7/95.5/95.1} for the train/val/test splits in native space, and \textbf{95.4/95.7/96.3} in normalized space.\par
Tuning the model architecture, by searching different layer sizes and numbers, activation functions, dropout normalization, adjusting learning rate and batch size, did not increase the performance, not even for the train split, indicating that this is the absolute best this model can do.\par
Examples of the true/predicted records can be found in \reflink{fig:pred-tra-md}{Figures} \ref{fig:pred-val-md} \ref{fig:pred-tes-md}. And the loss training curves can be found in \reflink{fig:curve-md}{Figure}.

\section{Relative Connectivity Segmentation}

All numerical results corresponding to the Relative Connectivity Segmentation experiments can be found in \reflink{fig:con-nat-t1}{Tables} \reflink{fig:con-arch}{-}.
The baseline starting experiment is trying to predict the Relative Connectivity (preprocessed with the method described in \reflink{sec:conpre}{subsection}) from a single set of voxel based radiomic features, with a kernel size of 5, and with the same starting hyperparameters (\reflink{tab:subhyp}{Table}) that were also used in the subcortical segmentation.\par
The subsequent experiments aimed to determine how does each set (target regions, \ac{ROI}, and entire brain) of non-voxel based features affect the model performance. The results were fairly consistent between the 4 different group of experiments (Native-Normalized & T1-T1/T2), with the final consensus being that the inclusion of non-voxel based features does not improve model performance.\par
The biggest improvement (5-10\%) was obtained with the inclusion of many different kernel sized voxel-based features.\par
The experiments consistently showed the model performing much better on the Control records, compared to the Patient records, with much less overfitting and better accuracy (by 2-5\%).\par
The inclusion of the clinical features yielded inconsistent results between the four groups of experiments. For the normalized experiments, it mostly had no effect, or made it marginally worse, while for the native T1 experiments, the inclusion of \ac{CAP} and \ac{cUHDRS} features marginally improved the model performance. Finally, for the native T1/T2, it increased train/validation performance substantially, but yielded worse test performance, due to strong overfitting.\par
Mixing Control and Patient records only performed marginally worse than using only Control records.\par
Including coordinates, consistently increased accuracy by 1-2\%.\par
Only using min-max scaling, and not normalizing the datapoints, resulted in marginally worse performance.\par
Increasing the bin size for the voxel based radiomic features marginally decreased the model performance.\par
Balancing the data consistently and substantially decreased performance (depending on the balance ratio by 5-20\%)\par
The addition of the 10 extra T1 records as part of the training split for the T1 experiments did not affect the model performance.\par
After combining all of the best configurations, the best performing model was the T1 normalized model, with Control records only, with the additional coordinate inputs, without any additional non-voxel based features. It reached a final accuracy of 72.6/72.1/73.3 for the train/val/test splits in native space, and 73.2/71.9/73 in normalized space.\par
After tuning the model architecture, by searching different layer sizes and numbers, activation functions, dropout normalization, adjusting learning rate and batch size, the only thing which marginally increased model performance was lowering the batch size to $10^3$ and lowering the learning rate to $10^{-4}$, yielding a final accuracy of \textbf{73.3/72.9/73.4} in native space, and \textbf{73.5/72.3/73.4} in normalized space.\par
As these numbers can be misleading due to the highly unbalanced data, the best way to get more insight on how the model is performing is by observing the confusion matrices in \reflink{fig:conf_prec}{Figure} and \reflink{fig:conf_rec}{Figure}. Matrices in \reflink{fig:conf_prec}{Figure} are normalized along the predicted label axis, effectively displaying the precision in the diagonals; in \reflink{fig:conf_rec}{Figure}, they are normalized along the true label axis, effectively displaying the recall in the diagonals. The first and most evident observation is that the unbalanced nature of the data is reflected on the confusion matrix, as the over-represented 'not connected' datapoints have a much better precision and recall than the rest.\par
Also, the model is more effective at minimizing false positives than it is at minimizing false negatives, since it generally has a higher precision than recall for practically all labels (except the 'not connected').\par
Examples of the true/predicted records can be found in \reflink{fig:pred-tra-con}{Figures} \ref{fig:pred-val-con} \ref{fig:pred-tes-con}. And the loss training curves can be found in \reflink{fig:curve-con}{Figure}.

These matrices also tell that not all labels are performing equally. As the model clearly struggles with the recall of 'temporal' target region datapoints.

\subsection{Exhaustive Sequential Backwards Feature Selection}
\label{sec:seqback}

Exhaustive sequential backwards feature selection, is a about training the model iteratively by removing a single feature at a time, going through all features. After an iteration is done, the best performing model is chosen, and the corresponding feature is permanently removed before the next iteration, where the model goes through the remaining $n-1$ features.\par
And the stopping criteria can be varied from setup to setup, but in this case the evaluation metric was chosen to be the validation raw accuracy, and a stopping point of where all runs in the iteration performed worse than the baseline (the model with all features included) by more than 2\%.\par
Feature selection was only ran for the Relative Connectivity Segmentation problem, due to it being time consuming and computationally intensive. This was executed on a network cluster, where the cluster head would give out tasks (a task being a model to train with a set of features to exclude), and the workers returning the validation accuracy.\par
There were 2 logistical oversights that were not mitigated in time. The first mistake being that the execution of the feature selection was rushed due to the longevity of the task, and the rest of the hyperparameters (besides the excluded features) were chosen before finishing the basic experimentation. And the second being an indirect consequence to it being rushed, and it was the usage of a bugy code that was responsible for balancing the data, as the bug was found after already executing the feature selection.\par
Due to these mistakes, the selected features turned out not to be very efficient with the final hyperparameters. The feature selection was not executed again due to time and resource limitations. More information detailing this mistake and oversight can be found in \reflink{sec:improve}{Future Improvements} subsection.\par
Nevertheless the expected result of re-running the feature selection would be something similar to the current sub-optimal result. Where around 1/3rd of the features could be excluded before stopping and a maximum increase of 2\% for the validation accuracy. The first features to be excluded was predominantly from the firstorder feature class, followed by the \ac{GLCM} feature class.

\subsection{Streamline Regression}

Another approach would be to try predicting the raw streamline images, and then process the predictions the same way as the relative connectivity labels were computed in the first place. This method could result in a more robust solution with predicting a the upstream data, before preprocessing.\par

Training 7 expert models for the 7 streamline images (to each cortical target), with the same hyperparameters as the best performing model from the relative connectivity segmentation, yielded underwhelming results. With the computed accuracies being 65.1/65.3/63.8, and terrible precision/recall on all labels (except the 'not connected'), which is explained by the predicted labels mainly being 'not connected'.\par

This approach was not explored further in depth due to limited time and resources.
