  abstract = {The striatum and its cortical circuits play central roles in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The striatum is subdivided by cortical connections and functions; however, the anatomical aberrations in different cortico-striatal connections and coexisting microstructural anomalies in striatal subregions of OCD patients are poorly understood. Thus, we aimed to elucidate the aberrations in cortico-striatal white matter (WM) connectivity and the associated subregional microstructure of the striatum in patients with OCD. From diffusion tensor/kurtosis imaging of 107 unmedicated OCD patients and 110 matched healthy controls (HCs), we calculated the cortico-striatal WM connectivity and segmented the striatum using probabilistic tractography. For the segmented striatal subregions, we measured average diffusion kurtosis values, which represent microstructural complexity. Connectivity and mean kurtosis values in each cortical target and associated striatal subregions were compared between groups. We identified significantly reduced orbitofrontal WM connectivity with its associated striatal subregion in patients with OCD compared to that in HCs. However, OCD patients exhibited significantly increased caudal-motor and parietal connectivity with the associated striatal subregions. The mean kurtosis values of the striatal subregions connected to the caudal-motor and parietal cortex were significantly decreased in OCD patients. Our results highlighted contrasting patterns of striatal WM connections with the orbitofrontal and caudal-motor/parietal cortices, thus supporting the cortico-striatal circuitry imbalance model of OCD. We suggest that aberrations in WM connections and the microstructure of their downstream regions in the caudal-motor-/parietal-striatal circuits may underlie OCD pathophysiology and further provide potential neuromodulation targets for the treatment of OCD.}

  abstract = {The "basal ganglia" refers to a group of subcortical nuclei responsible primarily for motor control, as well as other roles such as motor learning, executive functions and behaviors, and emotions. Proposed more than two decades ago, the classical basal ganglia model shows how information flows through the basal ganglia back to the cortex through two pathways with opposing effects for the proper execution of movement. Although much of the model has remained, the model has been modified and amplified with the emergence of new data. Furthermore, parallel circuits subserve the other functions of the basal ganglia engaging associative and limbic territories. Disruption of the basal ganglia network forms the basis for several movement disorders. This article provides a comprehensive account of basal ganglia functional anatomy and chemistry and the major pathophysiological changes underlying disorders of movement. We try to answer three key questions related to the basal ganglia, as follows: What are the basal ganglia? What are they made of? How do they work? Some insight on the canonical basal ganglia model is provided, together with a selection of paradoxes and some views over the horizon in the field.}

  abstract = {Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant trinucleotide repeat disorder that causes the progressive degeneration of the basal nuclei. This degeneration leads to clinical symptoms affecting voluntary movement, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric disorders. The patient affected by this disease demonstrates anticipation, meaning that even though there is normal embryological development, the signs and symptoms appear at an earlier age as the gene is continually passed throughout subsequent generations. The degeneration occurs due to the accumulation of the protein Huntingtin that destroys the medium spiny neurons located in the caudate and putamen, collectively termed the striatum. Four pathways converge onto the striatum known as the "input" center. These consist of the motor loop, oculomotor loop, association loop, and limbic loop. In each of these loops, the striatum maintains an inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic function. The imbalance of the inhibitory versus excitatory input directly relates to the symptoms seen in Huntington's disease such as the inability to control voluntary movements termed chorea, the inability to control voluntary saccadic ocular movements, the cognitive inability to plan and determine the direction of movement, and the inability to control the emotional and motivational aspects of the movement. There is currently no cure for Huntington's disease but there is a symptomatic treatment for the chorea and psychiatric conditions. Further research is being done to determine the pathophysiology behind the Hungtintin protein to allow for a targeted treatment regimen while also looking into reliable biomarkers for the progression of Huntington's disease.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of gray-level discretization on inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of texture radiomics features on clinical MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied two independent MRI datasets of 74 lacrymal gland tumors and 30 breast lesions from two different centers. Two pairs of readers performed three two-dimensional delineations for each dataset. Texture features were extracted using two radiomics softwares (Pyradiomics and an in-house software). Reproducible features were selected using a combination of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance and coherence coefficient (CCC) with 0.8 and 0.9 as thresholds, respectively. We tested six absolute and eight relative gray-level discretization methods and analyzed the distribution and highest number of reproducible features obtained for each discretization. We also analyzed the number of reproducible features extracted from computer simulated delineations representative of inter-observer variability. RESULTS: The gray-level discretization method had a direct impact on texture feature reproducibility, independent of observers, software or method of delineation (simulated vs. human). The absolute discretization consistently provided statistically significantly more reproducible features than the relative discretization. Varying the bin number of relative discretization led to statistically significantly more variable results than varying the bin size of absolute discretization. CONCLUSIONS: When considering inter-observer reproducible results of MRI texture radiomics features, an absolute discretization should be favored to allow the extraction of the highest number of potential candidates for new imaging biomarkers. Whichever the chosen method, it should be systematically documented to allow replicability of results.}

  abstract = {We study changes in the aggregate carbon intensity (ACI) for electricity at the global and country levels. The ACI is defined as the energy-related CO2 emissions in electricity production divided by the electricity produced. It is a performance indicator since a decrease in its value is a desirable outcome from the environmental and climate change viewpoints. From 1990 to 2013, the ACI computed at the global level decreased only marginally. However, fairly substantial decreases were observed in many countries. This apparent anomaly arises from a geographical shift in global electricity production with countries having a high ACI increasingly taking up a larger electricity production share. It is found that globally and in most major electricity producing countries, reduction in their ACI was due mainly to improvements in the thermal efficiency of electricity generation rather than to fuel switching. Estimates of the above-mentioned effects are made using LMDI decomposition analysis. Our study reveals several challenges in reducing global CO2 emissions from the electricity production sector although technically the reduction potential for the sector is known to be great.}

Documented sex differences in brain structure are typically taken to support this dimorphic view of the brain. However, neuroanatomical data reveal that sex interacts with other factors <italic>in utero</italic> and throughout life to determine the structure of the brain, and that because these interactions are complex, the result is a multi-morphic, rather than a dimorphic, brain. More specifically, here I argue that human brains are composed of an ever-changing heterogeneous mosaic of “male” and “female” brain characteristics (rather than being all “male” or all “female”) that cannot be aligned on a continuum between a “male brain” and a “female brain.” I further suggest that sex differences in the direction of change in the brain mosaic following specific environmental events lead to sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>}
