  abstract = "Radiomics is a rapidly evolving field of research concerned with the extraction of quantitative metrics-the so-called radiomic features-within medical images. Radiomic features capture tissue and lesion characteristics such as heterogeneity and shape and may, alone or in combination with demographic, histologic, genomic, or proteomic data, be used for clinical problem solving. The goal of this continuing education article is to provide an introduction to the field, covering the basic radiomics workflow: feature calculation and selection, dimensionality reduction, and data processing. Potential clinical applications in nuclear medicine that include PET radiomics-based prediction of treatment response and survival will be discussed. Current limitations of radiomics, such as sensitivity to acquisition parameter variations, and common pitfalls will also be covered."

Specifically, these parameters are objective, and insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here, these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from the effective diffusion tensor,D, which is estimated in each voxel. First,Dis decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts, 〈D〉IandD− 〈D〉I, respectively (where 〈D〉 = Trace(D)/3 is the mean diffusivity, andIis the identity tensor). Then, the tensor (dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion tensor images (in whichDis estimated in each voxel from a series of 2D-FT spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain. Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and disease.}

  abstract = {The white matter is the medullary core of the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and also consists of connecting fiber bundles in the brainstem and spinal cord. The main function of the white matter is to connect neurons from different brain regions to each other by myelinated nerve fibers. Its glistening white color is due to the abundant presence of lipids in the myelin sheaths. The latter are formed by tightly wrapped membranous structures issued from oligodendrocytes. On positron emission tomography, the regional cerebral blood flow and regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen are much lower in the white matter, with a slightly greater increase of the oxygen extraction fraction, compared with the cerebral cortex. The arterial blood vessels of the white matter are derived, instead, from the leptomeningeal arteries and consist of short medullary branches for the subcortical arcuate fibers and of long medullary branches, converging to the ventricular wall, for the deep white matter. This arterial angioarchitecture is due to the regression of the transhemispheric vascular loops during the embryonic development of the brain.}

  abstract = {The "basal ganglia" refers to a group of subcortical nuclei responsible primarily for motor control, as well as other roles such as motor learning, executive functions and behaviors, and emotions. Proposed more than two decades ago, the classical basal ganglia model shows how information flows through the basal ganglia back to the cortex through two pathways with opposing effects for the proper execution of movement. Although much of the model has remained, the model has been modified and amplified with the emergence of new data. Furthermore, parallel circuits subserve the other functions of the basal ganglia engaging associative and limbic territories. Disruption of the basal ganglia network forms the basis for several movement disorders. This article provides a comprehensive account of basal ganglia functional anatomy and chemistry and the major pathophysiological changes underlying disorders of movement. We try to answer three key questions related to the basal ganglia, as follows: What are the basal ganglia? What are they made of? How do they work? Some insight on the canonical basal ganglia model is provided, together with a selection of paradoxes and some views over the horizon in the field.}

The aimsof this study were to characterise altered patterns of basalganglia-cortical structural connectivity with high anatomicalprecision in premanifest and early manifest HD, and to identifyassociations between structural connectivity and genetic orclinical markers of HD. 3-Tesla diffusion tensor magneticresonance images were acquired from 14 early manifest HDsubjects, 17 premanifest HD subjects and 18 controls. Voxel-basedanalyses of probabilistic tractography were used to quantifybasal ganglia-cortical structural connections. Canonical variateanalysis was used to demonstrate disease-associated patterns ofaltered connectivity and to test for associations betweenconnectivity and genetic and clinical markers of HD; this is thefirst study in which such analyses have been used. Widespreadchanges were seen in basal ganglia-cortical structuralconnectivity in early manifest HD subjects; this has relevancefor development of therapies targeting the striatum. PremanifestHD subjects had a pattern of connectivity more similar to that ofcontrols, suggesting progressive change in connections over time.Associations between structural connectivity patterns and motorand cognitive markers of disease severity were present in earlymanifest subjects. Our data suggest the clinical phenotype inmanifest HD may be at least partly a result of alteredconnectivity."

  abstract = {Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant trinucleotide repeat disorder that causes the progressive degeneration of the basal nuclei. This degeneration leads to clinical symptoms affecting voluntary movement, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric disorders. The patient affected by this disease demonstrates anticipation, meaning that even though there is normal embryological development, the signs and symptoms appear at an earlier age as the gene is continually passed throughout subsequent generations. The degeneration occurs due to the accumulation of the protein Huntingtin that destroys the medium spiny neurons located in the caudate and putamen, collectively termed the striatum. Four pathways converge onto the striatum known as the "input" center. These consist of the motor loop, oculomotor loop, association loop, and limbic loop. In each of these loops, the striatum maintains an inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic function. The imbalance of the inhibitory versus excitatory input directly relates to the symptoms seen in Huntington's disease such as the inability to control voluntary movements termed chorea, the inability to control voluntary saccadic ocular movements, the cognitive inability to plan and determine the direction of movement, and the inability to control the emotional and motivational aspects of the movement. There is currently no cure for Huntington's disease but there is a symptomatic treatment for the chorea and psychiatric conditions. Further research is being done to determine the pathophysiology behind the Hungtintin protein to allow for a targeted treatment regimen while also looking into reliable biomarkers for the progression of Huntington's disease.}

Furthermore, it is a difficult process when there is a huge amount of data to assist. Extracting brain tumour regions from MRI images becomes challenging due to the great variety of appearances of brain tumours and how similar they are to normal tissues. In this paper, we have designed modified U-Net architecture under a deep-learning framework for the detection and segmentation of brain tumors from MRI images. The applied model has been evaluated on genuine images provided by Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Interventions BRATS 2020 datasets. Test accuracy of 99.4\% has been achieved using the above-mentioned dataset. A comparative review with other papers shows our model using U-Net performs better than other deep learning-based models.}

  abstract="Brain tumor is one of the leading causes of cancer death. Accurate segmentation and quantitative analysis of brain tumor are critical for diagnosis and treatment planning. Since manual segmentation is time-consuming, tedious and error-prone, a fully automatic method for brain tumor segmentation is needed. Recently, state-of-the-art approaches for brain tumor segmentation are built on fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) using either 2D or 3D convolutions. However, 2D convolutions cannot make full use of the spatial information of volumetric medical image data, while 3D convolutions suffer from high expensive computational cost and memory demand. To address these problems, we propose a novel Separable 3D U-Net architecture using separable 3D convolutions. Preliminary results on BraTS 2018 validation set show that our proposed method achieved a mean enhancing tumor, whole tumor, and tumor core Dice scores of 0.74932, 0.89353 and 0.83093 respectively. Finally, during the testing stage we achieved competitive results with Dice scores of 0.68946, 0.83893, and 0.78347 for enhancing tumor, whole tumor, and tumor core, respectively."

We present a new method of mapping cortical areas based on myelin content as revealed by T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) MRI. The method is generalizable across different 3T scanners and pulse sequences. We use the ratio of T1w/T2w image intensities to eliminate the MR-related image intensity bias and enhance the contrast to noise ratio for myelin. Data from each subject were mapped to the cortical surface and aligned across individuals using surface-based registration. The spatial gradient of the group average myelin map provides an observer-independent measure of sharp transitions in myelin content across the surface{\textemdash}i.e., putative cortical areal borders. We found excellent agreement between the gradients of the myelin maps and the gradients of published probabilistic cytoarchitectonically defined cortical areas that were registered to the same surface-based atlas. For other cortical regions, we used published anatomical and functional information to make putative identifications of dozens of cortical areas or candidate areas. In general, primary and early unimodal association cortices are heavily myelinated and higher, multimodal, association cortices are more lightly myelinated, but there are notable exceptions in the literature that are confirmed by our results. The overall pattern in the myelin maps also has important correlations with the developmental onset of subcortical white matter myelination, evolutionary cortical areal expansion in humans compared with macaques, postnatal cortical expansion in humans, and maps of neuronal density in non-human primates.}

T1w/T2w and R1 maps with matched total acquisition times were obtained from a young cohort in randomized order and using a test–retest design. Both methodologies showed cortical myelin maps that enhanced similar anatomical features, namely primary sensory regions known to be myelin rich. T1w/T2w maps showed increased robustness to movement artifacts in comparison to R1 maps, while the test re-test reproducibility of both methods was comparable. Based on Brodmann parcellation, both methods showed comparable variability within each region. Having parcellated cortical myelin maps into VDG11b areas of 4a, 4p, 3a, 3b, 1, 2, V2, and MT, both methods behave identically with R1 showing an increased variability between subjects. In combination with the test re-test evaluation, we concluded that this increased variability between subjects reflects relevant tissue variability. A high level of correlation was found between the R1 and T1w/T2w regions with regions of higher deviations being co-localized with those where the transmit RF field deviated most from its nominal value. We conclude that R1 mapping strategies might be preferable when studying different population cohorts where cortical properties are expected to be altered while T1w/T2w mapping will have advantages when performing cortical based segmentation.}

  abstract={Various MRI techniques, including myelin water imaging, T1w/T2w ratio mapping and diffusion-based imaging can be used to characterize tissue microstructure. However, surprisingly few studies have examined the degree to which these MRI measures are related within and between various brain regions. Therefore, whole-brain MRI scans were acquired from 31 neurologically-healthy participants to empirically measure and compare myelin water fraction (MWF), T1w/T2w ratio, fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD) in 25 bilateral (10 grey matter; 15 white matter) regions-of-interest (ROIs). Except for RD vs. T1w/T2w, MD vs. T1w/T2w, moderately significant to highly significant correlations (p < 0.001) were found between each of the other measures across all 25 brain structures. However, while all six MRI measures were correlated with each other across all structures, there were large intra-ROI and inter-ROI differences (i.e., with no one measure consistently producing the highest or lowest values). This suggests that each quantitative MRI measure provides unique, and potentially complimentary, information about underlying brain tissues -- with each metric offering unique sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs to different microstructural properties (e.g., myelin content, tissue density, etc.).}

  ABSTRACT = {Positron emission tomography (PET) provides important additional information when applied in radiation therapy treatment planning. However, the optimal way to define tumors in PET images is still undetermined. As radiomics features are gaining more and more importance in PET image interpretation as well, we aimed to use textural features for an optimal differentiation between tumoral tissue and surrounding tissue to segment-target lesions based on three textural parameters found to be suitable in previous analysis (Kurtosis, Local Entropy and Long Zone Emphasis). Intended for use in radiation therapy planning, this algorithm was combined with a previously described motion-correction algorithm and validated in phantom data. In addition, feasibility was shown in five patients. The algorithms provided sufficient results for phantom and patient data. The stability of the results was analyzed in 20 consecutive measurements of phantom data. Results for textural feature-based algorithms were slightly worse than those of the threshold-based reference algorithm (mean standard deviation 1.2\%—compared to 4.2\% to 8.6\%) However, the Entropy-based algorithm came the closest to the real volume of the phantom sphere of 6 ccm with a mean measured volume of 26.5 ccm. The threshold-based algorithm found a mean volume of 25.0 ccm. In conclusion, we showed a novel, radiomics-based tumor segmentation algorithm in FDG-PET with promising results in phantom studies concerning recovered lesion volume and reasonable results in stability in consecutive measurements. Segmentation based on Entropy was the most precise in comparison with sphere volume but showed the worst stability in consecutive measurements. Despite these promising results, further studies with larger patient cohorts and histopathological standards need to be performed for further validation of the presented algorithms and their applicability in clinical routines. In addition, their application in other tumor entities needs to be studied.}

  abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the uncertainty of radiomics features from contrast-enhanced breath-hold helical CT scans of non-small cell lung cancer for both manual and semi-automatic segmentation due to intra-observer, inter-observer, and inter-software reliability.   Methods Three radiation oncologists manually delineated lung tumors twice from 10 CT scans using two software tools (3D-Slicer and MIM Maestro). Additionally, three observers without formal clinical training were instructed to use two semi-automatic segmentation tools, Lesion Sizing Toolkit (LSTK) and GrowCut, to delineate the same tumor volumes. The accuracy of the semi-automatic contours was assessed by comparison with physician manual contours using Dice similarity coefficients and Hausdorff distances. Eighty-three radiomics features were calculated for each delineated tumor contour. Informative features were identified based on their dynamic range and correlation to other features. Feature reliability was then evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Feature range was used to evaluate the uncertainty of the segmentation methods.   Results From the initial set of 83 features, 40 radiomics features were found to be informative, and these 40 features were used in the subsequent analyses. For both intra-observer and inter-observer reliability, LSTK had higher reliability than GrowCut and the two manual segmentation tools. All observers achieved consistently high ICC values when using LSTK, but the ICC value varied greatly for each observer when using GrowCut and the manual segmentation tools. For inter-software reliability, features were not reproducible across the software tools for either manual or semi-automatic segmentation methods. Additionally, no feature category was found to be more reproducible than another feature category. Feature ranges of LSTK contours were smaller than those of manual contours for all features.   Conclusion Radiomics features extracted from LSTK contours were highly reliable across and among observers. With semi-automatic segmentation tools, observers without formal clinical training were comparable to physicians in evaluating tumor segmentation.}

For comparison, we used a graphical-based method to generate semiautomated segmented volumes (GBSV). To address any perturbations in radiomic feature values, we down-sampled the tumor volumes into three gray-levels: 32, 64, and 128 from the original gray-level of 256. Finally, we analyzed the effect on radiomic features on PET images of eight patients due to four PET 3D-reconstruction algorithms: maximum likelihood-ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) iterative reconstruction (IR) method, fourier rebinning-ML-OSEM (FOREIR), FORE-filtered back projection (FOREFBP), and 3D-Reprojection (3DRP) analytical method. We extracted 79 features from all segmentation method, gray-levels of down-sampled volumes, and PET reconstruction algorithms. The features were extracted using gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM), gray-level size zone matrices (GLSZM), gray-level run-length matrices (GLRLM), neighborhood gray-tone difference matrices (NGTDM), shape-based features (SF), and intensity histogram features (IHF). We computed the Dice coefficient between each MTV and GBSV to measure segmentation accuracy. Coefficient values close to one indicate high agreement, and values close to zero indicate low agreement. We evaluated the effect on radiomic features by calculating the mean percentage differences () between feature values measured from each pair of parameter elements (i.e. segmentation methods: MTV1-MTV2, MTV1-GBSV, MTV2-GBSV; gray-levels: 64-32, 64-128, and 64-256; reconstruction algorithms: OSEM-FORE-OSEM, OSEM-FOREFBP, and OSEM-3DRP). We used as a measure of radiomic feature reproducibility level, where any feature scored ±SD ≤ |25|\% ± 35\% was considered reproducible. We used Bland–Altman analysis to evaluate the mean, standard deviation (SD), and upper/lower reproducibility limits (U/LRL) for radiomic features in response to variation in each testing parameter. Furthermore, we proposed U/LRL as a method to classify the level of reproducibility: High— ±1\% ≤ U/LRL ≤ ±30\%; Intermediate— ±30\% < U/LRL ≤ ±45\%; Low— ±45 < U/LRL ≤ ±50\%. We considered any feature below the low level as nonreproducible (NR). Finally, we calculated the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to evaluate the reliability of radiomic feature measurements for each parameter. The segmented volumes of 65 patients (81.3\%) scored Dice coefficient >0.75 for all three volumes. The result outcomes revealed a tendency of higher radiomic feature reproducibility among segmentation pair MTV1-GBSV than MTV2-GBSV, gray-level pairs of 64-32 and 64-128 than 64-256, and reconstruction algorithm pairs of OSEM-FOREIR and OSEM-FOREFBP than OSEM-3DRP. Although the choice of cervical tumor segmentation method, gray-level value, and reconstruction algorithm may affect radiomic features, some features were characterized by high reproducibility through all testing parameters. The number of radiomic features that showed insensitivity to variations in segmentation methods, gray-level discretization, and reconstruction algorithms was 10 (13\%), 4 (5\%), and 1 (1\%), respectively. These results suggest that a careful analysis of the effects of these parameters is essential prior to any radiomics clinical application.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of gray-level discretization on inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of texture radiomics features on clinical MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied two independent MRI datasets of 74 lacrymal gland tumors and 30 breast lesions from two different centers. Two pairs of readers performed three two-dimensional delineations for each dataset. Texture features were extracted using two radiomics softwares (Pyradiomics and an in-house software). Reproducible features were selected using a combination of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance and coherence coefficient (CCC) with 0.8 and 0.9 as thresholds, respectively. We tested six absolute and eight relative gray-level discretization methods and analyzed the distribution and highest number of reproducible features obtained for each discretization. We also analyzed the number of reproducible features extracted from computer simulated delineations representative of inter-observer variability. RESULTS: The gray-level discretization method had a direct impact on texture feature reproducibility, independent of observers, software or method of delineation (simulated vs. human). The absolute discretization consistently provided statistically significantly more reproducible features than the relative discretization. Varying the bin number of relative discretization led to statistically significantly more variable results than varying the bin size of absolute discretization. CONCLUSIONS: When considering inter-observer reproducible results of MRI texture radiomics features, an absolute discretization should be favored to allow the extraction of the highest number of potential candidates for new imaging biomarkers. Whichever the chosen method, it should be systematically documented to allow replicability of results.}

We assessed the internal consistency and the intercorrelations for the four domains and examined changes in ratings over time. We also performed an interrater reliability study of the motor assessment. We found there was a high degree of internal consistency within each of the domains of the UHDRS and that there were significant intercorrelations between the domains of the UHDRS, with the exception of the total behavioral score. There was an excellent degree of interrater reliability for the motor scores. Our limited longitudinal database indicates that the UHDRS may be useful for tracking changes in the clinical features of HD over time. The UHDRS assesses relevant clinical features of HD and appears to be appropriate for repeated administration during clinical studies."

It is very robust and accurate and has been tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and taken with a wide variety of MR sequences. The method, Brain Extraction Tool (BET), uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the results of extensive quantitative testing against “gold-standard” hand segmentations, and two other popular automated methods. Hum.

  abstract = {Abstract To estimate diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) measures, such as fractional anisotropy and fiber orientation, reliably, a large number of diffusion-encoded images is needed, preferably cardiac gated to reduce pulsation artifacts. However, the concomitant longer acquisition times increase the chances of subject motion adversely affecting the estimation of these measures. While correcting for motion artifacts improves the accuracy of DTI, an often overlooked step in realigning the images is to reorient the B-matrix so that orientational information is correctly preserved. To the best of our knowledge, most research groups and software packages currently omit this reorientation step. Given the recent explosion of DTI applications including, for example, neurosurgical planning (in which errors can have drastic consequences), it is important to investigate the impact of neglecting to perform the B-matrix reorientation. In this work, a systematic study to investigate the effect of neglecting to reorient the B-matrix on DTI data during motion correction is presented. The consequences for diffusion fiber tractography are also discussed. Magn Reson Med, 61:1336–1349, 2009. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}

  abstract={Evidence concerning anatomical connectivities in the human brain is sparse and based largely on limited post-mortem observations. Diffusion tensor imaging has previously been used to define large white-matter tracts in the living human brain, but this technique has had limited success in tracing pathways into gray matter. Here we identified specific connections between human thalamus and cortex using a novel probabilistic tractography algorithm with diffusion imaging data. Classification of thalamic gray matter based on cortical connectivity patterns revealed distinct subregions whose locations correspond to nuclei described previously in histological studies. The connections that we found between thalamus and cortex were similar to those reported for non-human primates and were reproducible between individuals. Our results provide the first quantitative demonstration of reliable inference of anatomical connectivity between human gray matter structures using diffusion data and the first connectivity-based segmentation of gray matter.}

Using automatic relevance determination, we are able to perform online selection of the number of fibre orientations supported by the data at each voxel, simplifying the problem of tracking in a multi-orientation field. We then apply the identical probabilistic algorithm to tractography in the multi- and single-fibre cases in a number of example systems which have previously been tracked successfully or unsuccessfully with single-fibre tractography. We show that multi-fibre tractography offers significant advantages in sensitivity when tracking non-dominant fibre populations, but does not dramatically change tractography results for the dominant pathways.}

To ensure optimal decision-making, the weight given to decision outcomes should reflect their salience in predicting future outcomes, and this salience should be modulated by the volatility of the reward environment. We show that human subjects assess volatility in an optimal manner and adjust decision-making accordingly. This optimal estimate of volatility is reflected in the fMRI signal in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when each trial outcome is observed. When a new piece of information is witnessed, activity levels reflect its salience for predicting future outcomes. Furthermore, variations in this ACC signal across the population predict variations in subject learning rates. Our results provide a formal account of how we weigh our different experiences in guiding our future actions.}

  abstract = {The striatum acts in conjunction with the cortex to control and execute functions that are impaired by abnormal dopamine neurotransmission in disorders such as Parkinson's and schizophrenia. To date, in vivo quantification of striatal dopamine has been restricted to structure-based striatal subdivisions. Here, we present a multimodal imaging approach that quantifies the endogenous dopamine release following the administration of d-amphetamine in the functional subdivisions of the striatum of healthy humans with [11C]PHNO and [11C]Raclopride positron emission tomography ligands. Using connectivity-based (CB) parcellation, we subdivided the striatum into functional subregions based on striato-cortical anatomical connectivity information derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and probabilistic tractography. Our parcellation showed that the functional organization of the striatum was spatially coherent across individuals, congruent with primate data and previous diffusion MRI studies, with distinctive and overlapping networks. d-amphetamine induced the highest dopamine release in the limbic followed by the sensory, motor, and executive areas. The data suggest that the relative regional proportions of D2-like receptors are unlikely to be responsible for this regional dopamine release pattern. Notably, the homogeneity of dopamine release was significantly higher within the CB functional subdivisions in comparison with the structural subdivisions. These results support an association between local levels of dopamine release and cortical connectivity fingerprints.}

  abstract = {We study changes in the aggregate carbon intensity (ACI) for electricity at the global and country levels. The ACI is defined as the energy-related CO2 emissions in electricity production divided by the electricity produced. It is a performance indicator since a decrease in its value is a desirable outcome from the environmental and climate change viewpoints. From 1990 to 2013, the ACI computed at the global level decreased only marginally. However, fairly substantial decreases were observed in many countries. This apparent anomaly arises from a geographical shift in global electricity production with countries having a high ACI increasingly taking up a larger electricity production share. It is found that globally and in most major electricity producing countries, reduction in their ACI was due mainly to improvements in the thermal efficiency of electricity generation rather than to fuel switching. Estimates of the above-mentioned effects are made using LMDI decomposition analysis. Our study reveals several challenges in reducing global CO2 emissions from the electricity production sector although technically the reduction potential for the sector is known to be great.}
