  abstract = {The white matter is the medullary core of the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and also consists of connecting fiber bundles in the brainstem and spinal cord. The main function of the white matter is to connect neurons from different brain regions to each other by myelinated nerve fibers. Its glistening white color is due to the abundant presence of lipids in the myelin sheaths. The latter are formed by tightly wrapped membranous structures issued from oligodendrocytes. On positron emission tomography, the regional cerebral blood flow and regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen are much lower in the white matter, with a slightly greater increase of the oxygen extraction fraction, compared with the cerebral cortex. The arterial blood vessels of the white matter are derived, instead, from the leptomeningeal arteries and consist of short medullary branches for the subcortical arcuate fibers and of long medullary branches, converging to the ventricular wall, for the deep white matter. This arterial angioarchitecture is due to the regression of the transhemispheric vascular loops during the embryonic development of the brain.}

anatomic details, diffusion tensor imaging offers the potential to identify structural and functional adaptations before gross anatomical changes, such as lesions and tumors, become apparent on conventional MRI. Over the past 10 years, further parameters, such as axial and radial diffusivity, have been developed to characterize white matter changes specific to axons and myelin. In this paper, the potential application and outstanding issues on the use of diffusion tensor imaging directional diffusivity as a biomarker in axonal and myelin damage in neurological disorders will be reviewed."

  abstract = {The striatum and its cortical circuits play central roles in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The striatum is subdivided by cortical connections and functions; however, the anatomical aberrations in different cortico-striatal connections and coexisting microstructural anomalies in striatal subregions of OCD patients are poorly understood. Thus, we aimed to elucidate the aberrations in cortico-striatal white matter (WM) connectivity and the associated subregional microstructure of the striatum in patients with OCD. From diffusion tensor/kurtosis imaging of 107 unmedicated OCD patients and 110 matched healthy controls (HCs), we calculated the cortico-striatal WM connectivity and segmented the striatum using probabilistic tractography. For the segmented striatal subregions, we measured average diffusion kurtosis values, which represent microstructural complexity. Connectivity and mean kurtosis values in each cortical target and associated striatal subregions were compared between groups. We identified significantly reduced orbitofrontal WM connectivity with its associated striatal subregion in patients with OCD compared to that in HCs. However, OCD patients exhibited significantly increased caudal-motor and parietal connectivity with the associated striatal subregions. The mean kurtosis values of the striatal subregions connected to the caudal-motor and parietal cortex were significantly decreased in OCD patients. Our results highlighted contrasting patterns of striatal WM connections with the orbitofrontal and caudal-motor/parietal cortices, thus supporting the cortico-striatal circuitry imbalance model of OCD. We suggest that aberrations in WM connections and the microstructure of their downstream regions in the caudal-motor-/parietal-striatal circuits may underlie OCD pathophysiology and further provide potential neuromodulation targets for the treatment of OCD.}

  abstract = {The "basal ganglia" refers to a group of subcortical nuclei responsible primarily for motor control, as well as other roles such as motor learning, executive functions and behaviors, and emotions. Proposed more than two decades ago, the classical basal ganglia model shows how information flows through the basal ganglia back to the cortex through two pathways with opposing effects for the proper execution of movement. Although much of the model has remained, the model has been modified and amplified with the emergence of new data. Furthermore, parallel circuits subserve the other functions of the basal ganglia engaging associative and limbic territories. Disruption of the basal ganglia network forms the basis for several movement disorders. This article provides a comprehensive account of basal ganglia functional anatomy and chemistry and the major pathophysiological changes underlying disorders of movement. We try to answer three key questions related to the basal ganglia, as follows: What are the basal ganglia? What are they made of? How do they work? Some insight on the canonical basal ganglia model is provided, together with a selection of paradoxes and some views over the horizon in the field.}

  abstract = {Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant trinucleotide repeat disorder that causes the progressive degeneration of the basal nuclei. This degeneration leads to clinical symptoms affecting voluntary movement, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric disorders. The patient affected by this disease demonstrates anticipation, meaning that even though there is normal embryological development, the signs and symptoms appear at an earlier age as the gene is continually passed throughout subsequent generations. The degeneration occurs due to the accumulation of the protein Huntingtin that destroys the medium spiny neurons located in the caudate and putamen, collectively termed the striatum. Four pathways converge onto the striatum known as the "input" center. These consist of the motor loop, oculomotor loop, association loop, and limbic loop. In each of these loops, the striatum maintains an inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic function. The imbalance of the inhibitory versus excitatory input directly relates to the symptoms seen in Huntington's disease such as the inability to control voluntary movements termed chorea, the inability to control voluntary saccadic ocular movements, the cognitive inability to plan and determine the direction of movement, and the inability to control the emotional and motivational aspects of the movement. There is currently no cure for Huntington's disease but there is a symptomatic treatment for the chorea and psychiatric conditions. Further research is being done to determine the pathophysiology behind the Hungtintin protein to allow for a targeted treatment regimen while also looking into reliable biomarkers for the progression of Huntington's disease.}

  abstract = {Noninvasively mapping the layout of cortical areas in humans is a continuing challenge for neuroscience. We present a new method of mapping cortical areas based on myelin content as revealed by T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) MRI. The method is generalizable across different 3T scanners and pulse sequences. We use the ratio of T1w/T2w image intensities to eliminate the MR-related image intensity bias and enhance the contrast to noise ratio for myelin. Data from each subject were mapped to the cortical surface and aligned across individuals using surface-based registration. The spatial gradient of the group average myelin map provides an observer-independent measure of sharp transitions in myelin content across the surface{\textemdash}i.e., putative cortical areal borders. We found excellent agreement between the gradients of the myelin maps and the gradients of published probabilistic cytoarchitectonically defined cortical areas that were registered to the same surface-based atlas. For other cortical regions, we used published anatomical and functional information to make putative identifications of dozens of cortical areas or candidate areas. In general, primary and early unimodal association cortices are heavily myelinated and higher, multimodal, association cortices are more lightly myelinated, but there are notable exceptions in the literature that are confirmed by our results. The overall pattern in the myelin maps also has important correlations with the developmental onset of subcortical white matter myelination, evolutionary cortical areal expansion in humans compared with macaques, postnatal cortical expansion in humans, and maps of neuronal density in non-human primates.}

    abstract = {In this manuscript, we compare two commonly used methods to perform cortical mapping based on myelination of the human neocortex. T1w/T2w and R1 maps with matched total acquisition times were obtained from a young cohort in randomized order and using a test–retest design. Both methodologies showed cortical myelin maps that enhanced similar anatomical features, namely primary sensory regions known to be myelin rich. T1w/T2w maps showed increased robustness to movement artifacts in comparison to R1 maps, while the test re-test reproducibility of both methods was comparable. Based on Brodmann parcellation, both methods showed comparable variability within each region. Having parcellated cortical myelin maps into VDG11b areas of 4a, 4p, 3a, 3b, 1, 2, V2, and MT, both methods behave identically with R1 showing an increased variability between subjects. In combination with the test re-test evaluation, we concluded that this increased variability between subjects reflects relevant tissue variability. A high level of correlation was found between the R1 and T1w/T2w regions with regions of higher deviations being co-localized with those where the transmit RF field deviated most from its nominal value. We conclude that R1 mapping strategies might be preferable when studying different population cohorts where cortical properties are expected to be altered while T1w/T2w mapping will have advantages when performing cortical based segmentation.}

  abstract={Various MRI techniques, including myelin water imaging, T1w/T2w ratio mapping and diffusion-based imaging can be used to characterize tissue microstructure. However, surprisingly few studies have examined the degree to which these MRI measures are related within and between various brain regions. Therefore, whole-brain MRI scans were acquired from 31 neurologically-healthy participants to empirically measure and compare myelin water fraction (MWF), T1w/T2w ratio, fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD) in 25 bilateral (10 grey matter; 15 white matter) regions-of-interest (ROIs). Except for RD vs. T1w/T2w, MD vs. T1w/T2w, moderately significant to highly significant correlations (p < 0.001) were found between each of the other measures across all 25 brain structures. However, while all six MRI measures were correlated with each other across all structures, there were large intra-ROI and inter-ROI differences (i.e., with no one measure consistently producing the highest or lowest values). This suggests that each quantitative MRI measure provides unique, and potentially complimentary, information about underlying brain tissues -- with each metric offering unique sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs to different microstructural properties (e.g., myelin content, tissue density, etc.).}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of gray-level discretization on inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of texture radiomics features on clinical MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied two independent MRI datasets of 74 lacrymal gland tumors and 30 breast lesions from two different centers. Two pairs of readers performed three two-dimensional delineations for each dataset. Texture features were extracted using two radiomics softwares (Pyradiomics and an in-house software). Reproducible features were selected using a combination of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance and coherence coefficient (CCC) with 0.8 and 0.9 as thresholds, respectively. We tested six absolute and eight relative gray-level discretization methods and analyzed the distribution and highest number of reproducible features obtained for each discretization. We also analyzed the number of reproducible features extracted from computer simulated delineations representative of inter-observer variability. RESULTS: The gray-level discretization method had a direct impact on texture feature reproducibility, independent of observers, software or method of delineation (simulated vs. human). The absolute discretization consistently provided statistically significantly more reproducible features than the relative discretization. Varying the bin number of relative discretization led to statistically significantly more variable results than varying the bin size of absolute discretization. CONCLUSIONS: When considering inter-observer reproducible results of MRI texture radiomics features, an absolute discretization should be favored to allow the extraction of the highest number of potential candidates for new imaging biomarkers. Whichever the chosen method, it should be systematically documented to allow replicability of results.}

The ACI is defined as the energy-related CO2 emissions in electricity production divided by the electricity produced. It is a performance indicator since a decrease in its value is a desirable outcome from the environmental and climate change viewpoints. From 1990 to 2013, the ACI computed at the global level decreased only marginally. However, fairly substantial decreases were observed in many countries. This apparent anomaly arises from a geographical shift in global electricity production with countries having a high ACI increasingly taking up a larger electricity production share. It is found that globally and in most major electricity producing countries, reduction in their ACI was due mainly to improvements in the thermal efficiency of electricity generation rather than to fuel switching. Estimates of the above-mentioned effects are made using LMDI decomposition analysis. Our study reveals several challenges in reducing global CO2 emissions from the electricity production sector although technically the reduction potential for the sector is known to be great.}

However, neuroanatomical data reveal that sex interacts with other factors <italic>in utero</italic> and throughout life to determine the structure of the brain, and that because these interactions are complex, the result is a multi-morphic, rather than a dimorphic, brain.
