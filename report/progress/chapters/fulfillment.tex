\section{Objectives}

The end goal is to predict the relative connectivity of the Basal Ganglia to the cortical targets, from the radiomics features of the T1 and T1/T2 images.\par

This being a very complex problem, there is the possibility that the correlation between the connectivity of the brain and the T1, T1/T2 images are too weak to be mapped on this dataset. As from a datascience perspective, 69 datapoints are not much. But from a medical perspective it is substantial as it is very hard to collect uniform, clean data, with permissions to use it for research.\par

A simpler task leading up to the complex end goal, is a model for the simple segmentation of the Basal Ganglia for the subcortical regions Caudate, Putamen and Accumbens. In order to confirm that the radiomics texture of the T1 and T1/T2 images of this dataset are are correlated to the segmentation of the Basal Ganglia. This problem is inherently connected to the main goal, as the relative connectivity does obey certain anatomical restrictions, and the subcortical segmentation of the Basal Ganglia is confirmed to be related to the relative connectivity. Thus if this simpler prediction fails, there is a good chance that the complex end goal will fail as well.\par

Another intermediate task, is a model for predicting \ac{FA} and \ac{MD} images. This is also related to the main goal, as these images are computed from the \ac{dMRI} images, the same image that the relative connectivity was computed from. But it is inherently simpler, not needing to perform complex algorithms like tractography.\par

The biggest obstacle of this project is the preprocessing of the data, as there are many variations and hyperparameters that can be tuned. An exhaustive search definitely will not be viable, thus the preprocessing and model will needed to be tuned in a waterfall like manner, making educated guesses and comparing model performances across different tries. The main metric to measure model performance, will be the accuracy of the label prediction across voxels, as it should be comparable between all approaches. The accuracy metric will be used for the subcortical label prediction problem as well, and pearson correlation will be used as the metric to evaluate the \ac{FA} and \ac{MD} predictions.

\section{Motivation}

The motivation for predicting the connectivity maps from the T1 and T1/T2 \ac{MRI} images, is skipping the time and resource consuming process performing \ac{dMRI} and tractorgraphy.

As mentioned, an exhaustive search of the hyperparameter space is not feasible, thus it must be explored in a linear way. The following experiments are already done, or partially done:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Basal Ganglia subcortical segmentation
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sanity Check: tried to predict it from T1 to make sure there is no direct correlation
    \item Additional Non-Voxel Based Radiomics Inputs: experimented with additional non-voxel based radiomics features
    \item Radiomics Kernel Sizes: experimented with including voxel based features with different kernel sizes
    \item Short Conclusion: including multiple different kernel sizes are the best, non-voxel based features made no improvement, final test accuracy 0.91
  \end{itemize}
  \item Brain / Basal Ganglia diffusion \ac{FA} and \ac{MD} prediction
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \ac{FA}: predicted \ac{FA} in Basal Ganglia from many different kernel sizes (did not use any other features besides voxel based radiomics), yielded test pearson correlation of 0.92
    \item \ac{MD}: predicted \ac{MD} in Basal Ganglia from many different kernel sizes (did not use any other features besides voxel based radiomics), yielded test pearson correlation of 0.83
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

After completing the two simpler exercises, and confirming the viability of the thesis, I moved onto the relative connectivity prediction. I ran experiments for the following 6 configurations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item T1 native space
  \item T1/T2 native space
  \item T1 native space (excluding datapoints that are missing T1/T2 for fair comparison)

  \item T1/T2 normalized space
  \item T1 normalized space (excluding datapoints that are missing T1/T2 for fair comparison)
\end{itemize}

      \item left hemisphere
      \item right hemisphere
      \item both hemisphere

        \item included CAP \& UHRDs clinical data
        \item included all clinical data
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item both control \& huntington datapoints
    \begin{itemize}
      \item left hemisphere
      \item right hemisphere
      \item both hemisphere
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Tried two different model configurations, a simple FNN for classifying datapoints. And a dual model FNN, where one of them predicts the connectivity label and the other one is a regression model responsible for predicting the connectivity value of the strongest connection. The latter one can be used to 'reinforce' the not connected voxels, achieving a better accuracy. The best performing configuration so far was Native T1/T2, with all 9 voxel based features (without non-voxel based features), on control datapoints, with both left and right hemispheres included, yielding 0.62 accuarcy on the test datapoints. Some preliminary observations are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Right hemisphere datapoints are consistently easier to predict that left datapoints
  \item Control datapoints are consistently easier to predict that huntington datapoints
  \item Combining control and huntington datapoints inconsistently yielded same, or marginally better accuracy
  \item Combining right and left hemisphere datapoints inconsistently yielded same, or marginally better accuracy
  \item Including clinical data for the huntington datapoints resulted in less overfitting and better accuracy (BUT still worse than control datapoints)
  \item Multiple, larger kernel sizes are better (still experimenting what is the best)
  \item T1/T2 is better
  \item Including target region features resulted in less overfitting, and marginally worse accuracy
  \item Including basal ganglia features resulted in more overfitting, and worse accuracy
  \item Including basal ganglia and brain features resulted in more overfitting, and worse accuracy
  \item Dual FNN model (for not connected reinforcement) consistently yielded much better accuracy
\end{itemize}
